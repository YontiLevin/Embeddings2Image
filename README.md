# visualize-tsne
This small project is for creating 2d images of your tsne.   
The project was inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/cnnembed/) on the visualization of CNNs using t-sne.  
(this guy is pretty sharp :wink: - you should definitely follow him! )
